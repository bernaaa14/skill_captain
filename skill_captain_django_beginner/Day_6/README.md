### Tasks:
1. Create a new Django model representing a Store for the products and establish a relationship between the Product and Store models. One product can have many stores.

### Changes made:
- Added the Store model and implemented a foreign key relationship in which a product is able to have multiple stores

### Challenges faced:
- Not that of a challenge in entirety but I was looking at  and understanding 
django relationships, the admin interface made it definitely easier in terms of
doing different actions with the Product and Store models.
