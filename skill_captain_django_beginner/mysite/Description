Changes Made:
- Added additional fields under Profile (Age, Occupation, Email)
- Implemented a GET API endpoint in where it accepts name parameter and retrieve the data of the name
- Implemented an endpoint wherein it updates the email in the database with validations for the required fields.

Challenges faced:
- I had a great challenge in updating the email in the database,  usually I encounter a lot of errors mainly in the CSRF Token not being set. 
I spent a large amount of time figuring the workaround with it.
