## Challenges faced:
 I was first confused in terms of accessing the objects that I have created (which explains why the id count reached over 100), when I opened shell and tried to retrieve all of the objects it is showing me an empty queryset but after some time of running few failed commands on python shell and eventually fixing it, it had gotten a little smoother along the way for task 2-4.
